name: Publish Downloads Page

# Deploy docs/ to GitHub Pages on every push to main.
#
# The downloads page is generated dynamically from plugin.json files so it
# always reflects the current set of plugins without manual edits.
#
# Triggers when:
#   - Any plugin's plugin.json is added or changed (new/updated plugin)
#   - The page generator script changes
#   - Static assets in docs/ change
#   - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# One-time setup (repo owner):
#   Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions → Save
#
# After enabling, the page will be live at:
#   https://cirra-ai.github.io/skills/
