name: Publish Downloads Page

# Deploy docs/ to GitHub Pages on every push to main.
#
# docs/index.template.html is the page template: static content is maintained
# directly in that file; plugin and skill download cards are injected at build
# time from plugin.json files and skill README descriptions. The generated
# docs/index.html is gitignored and only exists after the workflow runs.
#
# Triggers when:
#   - docs/index.template.html (template) or other static assets change
#   - A plugin.json is added or changed (new/updated plugin)
#   - A skill README changes (updated description)
#   - The page generator script changes
#   - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# One-time setup (repo owner):
#   Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions → Save
