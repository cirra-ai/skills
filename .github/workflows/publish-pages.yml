name: Publish Downloads Page

# Deploy docs/ to GitHub Pages.
#
# docs/index.template.html is the page template: static content is maintained
# directly in that file; plugin and skill download cards are injected at build
# time from plugin.json files and skill README descriptions. The generated
# docs/index.html is gitignored and only exists after the workflow runs.
#
# Two pages are deployed on every run:
#   /              (docs/index.html)          — links to releases/latest/download/
#   /preview/      (docs/preview/index.html)  — links to releases/download/preview/
#
# Triggers:
#   - After 'Package & Publish' succeeds on main (keeps /preview/ current)
#   - When a release is published (updates / with the new official release)
#   - When page content files change on main (template, plugin metadata, READMEs)
#   - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# One-time setup (repo owner):
#   Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions → Save
