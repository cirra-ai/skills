name: Build & Publish

# Every push and every release trigger the same core steps:
#   - Package plugins and skills
#   - Copy zips into docs/ alongside the HTML page
#   - Generate downloads page with relative links (zips served from CF Pages)
#   - Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
#
# The CF Pages branch determines the URL:
#   release published → branch 'main'    → skills.cirra.ai        (production)
#   push to main      → branch 'preview' → preview.skills-cirra-ai.pages.dev
#   push to <branch>  → branch '<branch>' → <branch>.skills-cirra-ai.pages.dev
#
# On release, zips are also attached to the GitHub release for the release record.
