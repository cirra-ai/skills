## Original Credits

## PSLab - Permission Set Lab

This skill was inspired by **PSLab**, an open-source Salesforce permission analysis tool created by **Oumaima Arbani**.

- **GitHub**: [github.com/OumArbani/PSLab](https://github.com/OumArbani/PSLab)
- **Author**: Oumaima Arbani
- **License**: MIT

### What We Learned from PSLab

PSLab's Apex implementation provided the conceptual foundation for permission analysis:

1. **Permission Hierarchy Visualization** - The tree structure approach for showing PS/PSG relationships
2. **Permission Detection Queries** - The SOQL patterns for finding "who has access to X"
3. **User Permission Analysis** - The approach to tracing permissions through PSG membership
4. **Setup Entity Access** - How to query Apex class, VF page, and Custom Permission access

### License Compliance

This skill is a clean-room reimplementation of PSLab's concepts using Cirra AI MCP tools. No code was directly copied. The SOQL query patterns are based on standard Salesforce APIs.
